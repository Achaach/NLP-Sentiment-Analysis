When I tried to redeem the card, my Amazon app showed that the card with that claim code had already been redeemed. That is when I realized the the silver scratch coating was already removed when I removed it from the tin.

I immediately called Amazon. The call center rep informed me that the balance was redeemed by my ""friend or neighbor"". This must not be the first time this has happened, because the rep repeated the phrase as if it was part of his script. After I badgered him for several more minutes, I finally learned that the balance was stolen (my words, Amazon never conceded that this was the case) by someone in another state the day after my uncle ordered the card. I finally convinced the Amazon rep to elevate the problem.

""Elevation"" amounted to another email asking me for the claim code (the first rep had it already). All my follow-up calls required a complete re-explanation of the problem. Finally, a rep worked it out so I could get a series of refunds to make up for the stolen gift card amount.

Amazon has a systemic problem here. Someone was able to steal the gift card claim code, redeem it, and return the card to be shipped. I would love to know who, besides an Amazon employee, has this level of access. From my conversations with the customer service reps, I know that Amazon knew who received the stolen balance, knew when the theft happened, and knew that it happened before the gift card entered the mail system.

With all this information, Amazon's initial position was for me/my uncle to just suck up the loss. They then proceeded to give me the run-around for a problem that should have been easy to resolve.

I had received several of each (Amazon and iTunes) for Christmas gifts. The GIVER would not be aware of this problem; only the RECEIVER is inconvenienced by AMAZON gift cards security feature. Carefully scraping off the covering ""SCRATCH OFF GENTLY WITH A COIN FOR CLAIM CODE"" on the Amazon gift card often results in defacing the tiny superficial printing of the code, making the gift card UNUSABLE, since the code is unreadable.

Amazon, please fix this, you should have usability as good as or better than iTunes Gift Cards.

VERY DISAPPOINTED in AMAZON due to the poor design of this security feature.  I would not buy AMAZON Gift Cards unless this feature works better.

1. Compare with iTunes gift card, use of AMAZON gift cards is very messy. There is a lot of sticky, messy, waxy stuff resulting from the scraping, and after scraping the characters may be illegible, some completely unreadable.

2. The printing under the AMAZON security feature is tiny and often rubs off when trying to expose the code. This renders the card USELESS.

The server came back to me with the gift card I had provided after trying to process the card unsuccessfully.  When calling the number on the back of the card, apparently it wasn't open to help nor was there any way to check the balance on the card.  Lots of time wasted but the staff at the restaurant came back after many attempts and stated the card had not been activated.  So I call amazon customer service on the way home.  Their call center in the pines was unable to located the order even when provided with the order number.  After almost an hour on the phone, the representative found the problem was that the gift card had never been activated.  I've been a loyal amazon.com customer but this its a major disappointment to see amazon sell a gift card that was never activated.  Amazon's poor customer service by supervisor Rick who didn't even bother to understand what his subordinate had discovered only worsened a bad situation.  The inconsistencies between the explanations also worsened the situation.

Beware buying any gift cards from Amazon as they may not be activated and put you an an embarrassing position with the check and waste hours of your time trying to explain the matter to customer service in another country.

Would give this experience negative stars if possible.  Jeff I hope you are reading these reviews!  I don't expect this type of experience with Amazon.com.

Bought 2 $100 gift cards. The emails were promptly delivered, but the claim links in both emails do not work. Contacted Amazon, told us to contact whole foods. We contacted whole foods, but they do not recognize both the serial number and the order number in the Amazon emails and cannot help us track down what happened to the cards and why the links do not work. We then contacted Amazon more than 5 times over 3 weeks and wasted hours on the phone. Each time the customer service rep promises that the gift card department will reply us in two business days, but it has been 2 weeks now. The gift card department is probably ignoring us.

We've resigned to the fact that the money spent is irrecoverable, and are grateful that we did not lose more money than we did.

Seeing the number of 5 star comments on this product, it appears that the system works most of the time. Amazon knows that there really isn't anything to hold it accountable, so long as most of the customers are happy, it does not matter if a couple of customers occasionally get completely screwed over. When that happens, the only thing you'll get is sympathy from the customer service rep, and even that is unreliable.

So please be warned that when it fails, you are on your own. If you plan to buy in large denominations, we sincerely advice buying from whole foods directly.",We then contacted Amazon more than 5 times over 3 weeks and wasted hours on the phone,1457395200,

I've researched your Amazon.com Gift Card order and found that it may have been used by ""Susan Pebley"" someone other than the intended recipient. I'm not able to resend the gift card or refund the order.

To receive a refund, please contact the bank that issued the credit card used to purchase the gift card and dispute the charge. The bank will send paperwork for you to sign to verify any unauthorized charge. Your bank will then pass the appropriate paperwork on to us.

I hope you understand my limitations and help us to serve you better. We hope to see you again soon.

The card was set to arrive a day before her birthday but while the USPS tracking indicated that it had been delivered, my family let me know that they had not received it. Disappointed, I contacted the seller to have the card devalued and another one sent. I wasn't given a tracking number on the second one, which is understandable because it costs, like, a dollar to add that to a package. After two months of occasionally asking my family if they've gotten anything in the mail the card never got there and my sister is still without a gift. I would have been better off sending her a video of me burning $20.

While I can't say for sure whose fault it is, it does seem a little fishy that both cards failed to arrive. With my luck the devalued card will show up a month from now and my sister will go to the store and leave disappointed.

""I will just give her a gift card for Valentine's Day and she can purchase her own.""  So I sent off a gift card with a note telling her to buy herself a prime membership with it.  Lo and behold!  There was no option for her to buy the membership with a gift card.  Numerous futile phone calls ensued.  Endless holds while I waited my turn.  More endless holds while I waited for various worker bees to talk to their supervisors.  I finally gave up and my daughter and I came up with our own solution.  I don't make a lot of money either and I could not afford to give her the gift card AND buy her a membership which was what she truly needed for work.  I also needed a new crockpot because mine quit working but was going to put it off until I could budget it in.  So I put the money for a membership in her bank account and she bought me a crock pot and her membership and shipped it to me free .

The day my daughter and I came up with our own solution and she had already purchased her own membership, Amazon emailed me again with a solution of sorts.

I ordered this gift card as a Christmas present for my sister.  I purchased it on Amazon.com and had it shipped directly to her.  Next day shipping was perfect given that I waited until the last minute to do Christmas shopping, but that's where the good part of this card ended.  When my sister tried to enter the claim code on the card, she got an error message saying there was something wrong with the claim code.  She emailed customer service and the response she got was that she needed to have the sender (me) contact the store I bought the card from to have it activated.  Let me remind you that I purchased this card on Amazon.com.

So I got in touch with customer service via the online chat option and was told that my issue would have to be elevated to the gift card team and that the card could be activated in 24 to 48 hours.  I told the customer service rep that this was not an acceptable option.  Then the customer service rep said he'd see what he could do... and came back with the response that I need to go to the store I bought the card from and have make sure the store activates it.  Let me remind you yet again that I bought this card from Amazon.com.

Then I gave the customer service rep the card's claim code and the Amazon.com order number.  The next response I got was that the gift card's claim code did not match up with what was listed for the order number.  Ugh.  At this point the customer service rep suggested handing this off to the gift card team, which I agreed to.  A few hours later I got an email saying that my credit card would be refunded for this purchase.  I never asked for a refund... just wanted to get the gift card working, but in a round about way it did solve my problem because I then went ahead and bought an email gift certificate and that worked perfectly.

After this experience with the card not working and the repeated suggestion from customer service to go to the store I purchased the card from and have them activate it, when I did in fact buy it on Amazon.com, I would definitely steer away from the physical gift card and go for the email version instead.",Horrible Experience,1356566400,

Yet, neither one of us used it; it was still in the gift box.

I wasn't prepared for that with my credit card especially after the holidays, so of course it declined the extra 200.00 I was expecting the gift cards to have covered....
and I wanted to use the 300.00 in gift cards, not my credit card on my account from previous use of Amazon.

 I called customer service and kept getting a woman who I could not understand, telling me the same thing over and over as if she was reading from a script to me, telling me she couldn't help me and would forward my issue to another department and they would get back with me by email within 12 hours.

I get an email later stating i need to choose another payment method, as my credit card delined! UM, DUH! I didn't wish to use my card, I wanted to use the gift card balance!!

So, I wrote to explain this back to them and no answer, it has been a week, and my order was cancelled.

I bought $25 of this eGift card.  The email arrived a few minutes later and I successfully printed it out with bar code and clear instruction on how to use it.  The instruction says: Press gift card tender key prior to scanning this. Not available for use at self checkout.

Since I have never had a problem using eGift cards at other physical stores including Staples, Office Depot, CVS, BestBuy, etc., I didn't think this one could be a problem.  But I was wrong.

At the store checkout, the cashier called a manager over because he didn't know how to use it.  The manager took me to a different register and tried to follow the instruction but could not get it to work.  He said the store has updated its POS system a few months ago and there is no 'Gift Card' tender key anymore.  If he tried to scan the bar code without pressing ''Gift Card' tender key, he received 'payment not approved' message.  Eventually he was gracious enough to verify the balance of this eGift card and cashed this $25 out and applied cash as payment.  But he told his employees not to accept eGift cards anymore.

By the time I made it to their store a third time, all the valuable information on the card was gone (the barcode, the super important 9-digit ID, and the functionality of the magnetic strip).

After contacting Panera support, they want an insane amount of information to issue a new card (what store it was purchased at - and some don't count as in they won't support cards purchased many places probably including here at Amazon, the last 4 or 5 digits of the ID, the receipt, and a few other things - I deleted the email yesterday in frustration so I'm going by memory).

The point / warning here is that you need to be very careful with these cards and / or use them quickly or the paint will come off, the magnetic strip will fail, and customer service will not help you in any meaningful way.

Just a word of warning on the purchasing of Kindle Gift cards .. I recently bought two kindles for my daughters and bought a couple of gift cards to help introduce them .. Problem .. I am in Australia .. Amazon has just set up here with it's own Kindle site .. when you register Kindles it wants to register your account there .. You can only buy gift cards however from the US site .. which can't be redeemed on the Australian site .. all in all pretty messy and required a fair bit of working out how to transfer accounts etc .. it should have been a very simple process so hopefully will be addressed soon.

- Searching on the website and spending hours to find the information needed (which is not at all easy to find);
- Chatting with a moron who barely understands and copies and pastes standard replies in bad English;
- Sending emails and then having to call because they don't understand something as simple as returning a gift card that the gift receiver does not want.
I speak crystal-clear RP and speak quite slowly and still had difficulties making myself understood, and I am used to speaking to foreigners because I was an English teacher for 10 years.
IN SHORT AND TO ROUND UP THIS REVIEW: the gift is fine as long as you don't have to return it.
If you have the slightest doubt as to whether you will need to return it, don't buy it because it will take up inordinate amounts of time and possibly they will suggest crediting the money to your account or a million other things to avoid returning the money and make your life a misery until you either give in or give up.
SECONDLY - IMPORTANT ADVICE: don't send this gift to people you don't know because they might start asking for the recipient's phone number, billing address, secondary email address, or any number of details you don't have.
WE BELIEVED it was a good company gift for clients and promotions, but we were wrong because the return is almost impossible and because they start asking for all sorts of details that you could well have if you have given the card to a relative / friend but not if you are a company giving to clients or giving cards away in promotions.","CARD OK, RETURN OR REIMBURSEMENT NOT OK",1385596800,

I'd actually stopped going to this store for some time already, because of its high prices and general dissatisfaction...but, since this was the best I could do, with the eCard offerings Amazon gave me, I thought I'd try.

THEN, she said she had to keep the printout...and, since I still had a balance, I said, ""No, that's my card. I can still use it.""...and she said she needed it for her records, and kept it.

The only saving grace is that the eCard actually worked, and I got my stuff...AND, that when I got home and called Safeway corporate (# on receipt), they were very nice; they called the store and told them to give me back my printout; and, when I went to get it...they didn't give me any guff.

Went to Whole Foods store and they would not accept these numbers, said I needed a bar code on the gift card (there was none on the link I received).  BTW I am a Prime member and had the Whole Foods app on my phone which works fine.  Called the customer service number on the gift ""card"" (really just the page I printed out) and they said they were just third party and I should call Amazon.

2.0,38,False,"11 29, 2013",AEFTIUQHSVUFX,B00D2ZUNBQ,,Joe Z,"I reviewed this product a week or so ago and the author contacted me (That's a first!) and asked that I remove the review since he felt it would dissuade others from benefitting from his unique wisdom. Upon reflection, I may have been a bit harsh, so I will try to give as objective review as I can.

First, this is not a video. It is a PowerPoint presentation and the author reads every word on every page slowly...very...very...slowly. So slowly that I had to check during the lulls to see that the presentation was, in fact, advancing.

This is not the Ultimate anything. If you have a camera with buttons or dials you already have an inkling of what ISO, aperture, and shutter speed are. If you know these things and are looking for help composing pictures, well, you're pretty much out of luck there.

Here's a synopsis of the modules:

Module 1: Know your camera. If you're going to be fiddling with settings you need to know how to fiddle. Good advice.

Module 2: ISO. ISO is the sensitivity of the sensor in your digital camera. The higher the number, the more sensitive. But the higher the number the noisier, blurrier the image may be.

Module 3: Aperture. The aperture measures how wide open the lens is. The wider it is, the more light gets in. But, as with ISO, less will leave your pictures too dark and more may not always be better.

Module 3: Shutter Speed. Again, it controls how much light strikes the sensor by how fast it opens and closes.

Module 4: Putting it all together. A proper exposure is achieved by the proper combination of ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed. If you change one, you must change another. For instance: If you open the aperture, you must either lower the ISO or raise the shutter speed to get the correct exposure. Opening the aperture will let in more light, so you must make your sensor less sensitive via ISO or allow less light via a faster shutter speed.

Module 5: Metering. This is all about seeing light. If your subject is backlit, for instance, they will appear as a silhouette unless you meter on their face. This module is all about how and where to fix your attention, where to meter the light, and is pretty good actually.

Module 6: Light and Composition. There are things that make a good photo good. Rules that seem hard-wired into the human psyche. The author mentions them briefly. Things like the rule of 3rds, texturing, patterns and whatnot. Problem is he doesn't explain why these things work, much less provide examples to demonstrate how they work.

Module 7: Completion. Here the author summarizes what is, in my opinion, just a summary, hardly an Ultimate course, and emboldens the reader to go out and achieve greatness.

Not all that negative, hey? So why 2 stars. First, as I said, it is not Ultimate by any stretch of the imagination. More than half the book is dedicated to things you already know. And the area you really need help, well, he glosses over it leaving more questions than answers.

And second, it not a video. If you bought the author's book you have the script. Yes, he reads everything on every screen.

Third, he says the course is worth $250 then offers a special deep discount. I think that's lesson 1 in the (expletive deleted) marketing manual. Honestly, this would have made a good $2.50 Kindle e-book.

Lastly, the hype bugs me. The author states over and over how awesome your photographs will be if you just follow his rules. As if understanding a few fundamentals of photography will make you the next Bresson.

For my nephew's birthday, I decided to do just that. I picked out the 'Happy Birthday' gift card template, added some personalized words and selected a cool photo from our last vacation together. To my disappointment when I continued to the check out page Amazon had changed the template to a plain gift card, picture included, but  the 'Happy Birthday' message was replaced with 'A Gift for You' message. So plain and unspecial! I was not able to edit or change it back. I contacted customer service to ask why I was not able to have the Happy Birthday template which I selected  and the response I received was a very complicated set of instructions requiring me to cancel the order, resubmit, etc, etc. it was just a gift card! It was sent on his birthday! I had followed all of the instructions the first time! I had no intention of trying to cancel it and risk him being told his gft was worthless when he went to redeem it. I just hope the photo came through and he got a smile on his face! That was my intention all along. He did say in his thank you note he received an Amazon gift card, no mention of the cool photo.

So a relative went to Best Buy to ask for one, and she was handed an Amazon Kindle Gift Card. I wasn't sure if this would work for general Amazon purchases, so I sent an e-mail to Amazon customer service. The reply I received from Amazon was that the Kindle Gift Card can only be used for Kindle-related purchases, NOT for Amazon general merchandise. I tried to take the card back to Best Buy to exchange it for a regular Amazon gift card (which is what she asked for from the sales associate, so apparently, even retailers are unaware of this policy, although when I returned the manager knew this probably because others were trying to return their Kindle gift cards). Anyway, the manager there said it cannot be returned or exchanged, and confirmed it can only be used to make Kindle-related purchases. He said this is an Amazon return policy, not a Best Buy policy.

Now the real question is, why would anyone in their right mind want an Amazon Kindle Gift Card with all these limitations, when they could get a regular Amazon gift card and buy anything at the Amazon store, including Kindle related purchases. This is a ridiculous policy, and if anyone says I'm lying, I'll be happy to forward the e-mail I received from Amazon customer service concerning this issue.

*** UPDATE: Someone from Amazon called me to say if I first put the Amazon Kindle Gift Cards into my account using the number before making a purchase the money should be available for other purchases. They also sent me an e-mail with more specific instructions. Not sure if this is a rule change or what, but I appreciate them taking the time out to call me and leave another e-mail. I'll post the new e-mail below with the instructions (the first e-mail telling me it cannot be used this way is in the comments discussion to this review). Kudos to Amazon for listening to their customers if this is true (And I assume it is). I have not used the cards yet, and hadn't even scratched the off the cover over the numbers because I was thinking about trying to have Amazon exchange them for regular Amazon gift cards. Anyway, I'll bump up my rating to 3 stars (minus 2 for the misinformation) and the new e-mail is below:

Hello Bill,

I'm sorry for the misinformation you have previously received in an email from us about using your Gift Card for purchases on Amazon.com. I've tried contacting you at the phone number listed in your Amazon.com account but have been unsuccessful.

To use an Amazon.com Gift Card (or a Gift Card with the Kindle name on it) for purchases from Amazon.com, visit Your Account (http://www.amazon.com/your-account) and look for the gift card option in the Payments section.

You can also enter your gift card claim code during checkout in the box labeled ""Have any gift cards, gift certificates or promotional claim codes?"" in the right column. If you use 1-Click ordering, you'll find a similar option if you click ""Review or edit your 1-Click orders"" after clicking ""Buy now with 1-Click"" on a product's page.

You'll find more instructions here:

http://www.amazon.com/help/giftcards

If you still need help, you can contact us via phone, chat, or e-mail by clicking the ""Contact Us"" button on any Help page (http://www.amazon.com/help).

I hope this helps! We look forward to seeing you again soon.

This may sound nit-picky, but consider this- just after Christmas, on Amazon.co.uk there was a sale- the ""Twelve Days of Kindle"" sale.  Loads of Kindle Books for real cheap.  I got excited, browsed through, chose which ones I was going to use my gift card on, and was set to check out.  Looking at the check out page, though, I realized I wasn't going to be able to use the gift card, as it was only good on the US Amazon, not the UK Amazon.

I'm not ungrateful- $100 of free books is great, even if there are limitations.  But why do those limitations exist?  It's the same company, just a different country.  I haven't really looked into the legal complications, so perhaps there's a good reason why they legally can't allow us to use both sites.  However, to a layman just using the site, it seems a bit unfair that although I'm allowed to buy products from the two (separate, yes, yet identical down to, for all intents and purposes, the logo) sites using the same log-in name, I can't use my gift card on both.

I'm still left with only 3 that have verified balances with Brinker, which verifying is further complicated because Brinker will only allow so many cards to be verified (5, I think) in one 24 hr period, so I had to keep waiting a full day to check if what I had was any good.

You want to get something expensive, but don't have the money on any one card.
You want to send someone an instant gift card to their email to shop with
You simply don't like the physical variation

For people who don't have high limits on any cards, or have enough money in their checking account this is an especially convenient choice.

As Amazon doesn't allow you to pay with multiple cards, you would instead use your respective cards to buy yourself one of these gift cars. You redeem them to your account. Rinse and repeat.

This makes it so you can buy that one expensive item you normally could not afford on any one of your cards.

DOWNSIDE:

While the first 2 or 3 of these will be fairly instant (within 5 minutes) you will run into a wall if you try to buy to many at once. After about 3 in a short period of time Amazon will be forced to manually authorize each of these with their respective banks.

This can take 3-4 hours.

I have tried several other online gift cards before and sometimes encountered problems either with delivery to the recipient or some type of other delay. Dominos Pizza Gift Card seemed quick & easy to purchase and my friend in Texas loved it. It only took about 5-7 minutes in total for him to receive it. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because I feel that it should have come with more balance options instead of the $25 minimum (which was the only one I could see on my end as the minimum amount to purchase). If it came with the option to select more balances, preferably in $10s, $15s or $20s, it could potentially offer more affordability to customers who are looking to gift just a basic amount to friends or family members. That's my two cents. Overall, good choice of gift card!

When I wasn't able to do this through the Kindle Touch, however, I was able to load the Amazon gift card into my account using a browser on my laptop (connected via Wi-Fi).  Once the gift card was uploaded to my Amazon account, I could purchase books through my Kindle Touch using the gift credit in my Amazon account.  It would have been nice to provide the ability to load a gift card directly through the Kindle Touch without having to first go through a browser to load it into my Amazon account.  It would also have been nice to be able to select my payment method instead of automatically selecting the gift card for any purchase.  However, I purchased my book using the gift card and have enjoyed using my Kindle Touch ever since!

Also, I wish the Kindle Touch would provide an ""Are you sure?"" modal dialog before purchasing a product.  It seems too easy to accidentally buy something.  However, a nice feature is that I can cancel the order right after I purchase, but it would be nice to have the confirmation panel before doing so.

It is ideal for families and couples who are traveling together.  She had to evacuate during the latest Florida hurricane and managed to get a house with 5 bedrooms in mid Florida about 3 days before the storm would actually hit her area.  She  also uses them on weekend trips and is always so delighted to get one for her birthday or Christmas, so guess what she is getting this Christmas.

I am giving it only 4 stars instead of five because she came across a situation where she was to get a place in Washington for 2 nights at $100 per night.  .  The owner cancelled it.  She realized he charged  $500 a night to another person because of a march on Washington.  She has to stay in Virginia instead.  When she phoned up the company who run Airbnb, they said they had no control over this sort of thing - and refused to even take this particular renter off their list of people renting out their rooms or houses.  Also, there is no place on their Website for reviews of places people have stayed in, as at the very least, she could have written up a review about her disappointment and bad treatment.  In this respect Airbnb could certainly change their website.  It just isn't right to be allowed to spoil people's plans, because an event will bring them in 5 times the money.

Once I thought of Amazon (with the help of his wife)I logged in and followed the process.
How easy, so simple, so quick! Printed on my printer,easily folded and inserted into the Birthday Card AND I was the best sister in the world.

Small request: can you do them in multiples of $18 for bar and bat mitzvahs?  Even just $18, $36 and $180 would be enough.

In Judaism, the letters in the Hebrew word for ""life"" have a numeric value of 18 (Hebrew letters are associated with a number, kind of like Roman numerals).  So it's traditional to give gifts of $18 or $36 (a ""double life,"" so to speak) to commemorate rites of passage.","Always a crowd pleaser, but can you do $18 and $36 for bar and bat mitzvahs?",1507680000,

The smell is just like any other lotion with bronzers in it. My skin did not turn orange. I purposely left it on my palms and didn't wipe it off like everyone on the reviews said to, just so I could see if it really worked.  My hands are not orange.  I pretty much smeared myself in this stuff before I got into the bed because I loved how it went on.  I didn't get out and instantly see a tan like other people have said. I have slightly tan skin already from tanning but am naturally very very fair skinned. Later in the day, my skin got really dry from the bronzers.  I eventually looked quite a bit tanner. And by the next morning I was really dark. My legs usually take forever to show a tan and my abs are really dark. But this lotion made me have a pretty nice color by the next morning. I wouldn't ever use this without putting on a good rich lotion afterwards though because I drink 2 gallons of water/day and my skin was dry and dehydrated within about 2 hours after using this lotion.  So...bring a moisturizing lotion with you.  I am really happy with this lotion.  I will probably try a different kind for fun. And if I can't find another one that I like better then I will definitely buy this one again.  I like Black Smoke lotion better.  A lot of people hate that lotion but I still think it works better than this brand, minus the beautiful sheen this lotion gives you!  HAPPY I BOUGHT IT! WILL BUY AGAIN!",100x bronzer,1330646400,
