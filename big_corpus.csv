It's just a gift card but it made her happy none the less. She loves it and will get it every year. I would say she eats out at Taco Bell at least four times a week for lunch.

Gift cards are the best gifts. If you know what they like you don't have a problem with what size to get them or anything else, because any size fits.

Disclaimer - I paid full price for this item and this is an honest and trust worth review.

Coldstone Creamery is a great place to visit, the ice cream always tastes fresh, and they mix your add ins right in front of you. If you are lucky enough to have one near by, you can become addicted easily so be careful.

These ice cream gift cards always make a great present because in today's economy, sometimes it's hard to come up with extra money for treats.

The bean lights upto 100 meters in pitch darkness. The conical beam emerges and lights the immediate path of the rider very brightly while diminishing  further up. There are three intensity levels. They can be changed by holding the button for a second. I have only used the lowest intensity beam. A fully charged battery would last you 6-10 -hrs of riding if you use it economically (low intensity). It can be fully charged by a USB charger in about 3 hours .
Cons -  It does not have a 'flash' mode for daytime rides.
Mounting it everytime is cumbersome as the soft rubber strap needs to be inserted in the slot and the gap is not enough. At times this is even frustrating (in times of rush) when you have to bend to look carefully - almost like putting a threading the eye of the needle.

In the October one, once I let a package of 'Beef Top Sirloin' thaw, I found that the plastic had a crack in it, seemingly from the factory, and leaked all the juices out.  I did call customer service, and they did replace it, but I just now opened another 'Beef Top Sirloin' package that I let thaw for two or three days in the refrigerator, and again - the plastic it is sealed in didn't seal it.  This time I cannot find the crack or separation, but I really didn't look too hard since this is a common problem now.  I'm sure I could call them, send them a picture of the freshly opened package and get another replacement, but something tells me that I'll just tell my relatives that Omaha Steaks is having problems.",Quality control is lacking these days,1517097600,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jVS5gel+L._SY88.jpg']

So during the holidays, I usually buy stuff from Amazon and in general buy a lot of stuff from Amazon during the whole year anyway. Getting the gift card with a free bear was a no brainer for me! Ever since I learned about the free bear last year, I kept my eyes peeled for the 2016 Gund bear and almost thought the 'free' tradition was over. To my delight, they did the free bears this year too, hurray!

In comparison with the previous bear, it's the same size and is still as cute as ever. Somehow I can't get enough of this cute little bears and I'm sure so would you once you see them in person. These bears, though free, are great quality ""GUND"" brand bears. Seriously, buy them! If you don't really care for the bear but will spend the same amount in Amazon during the holidays anyway, the bear makes for a nice Christmas gift to your kid/niece/family friend or donate to a less privilege kid. Make someone smile during this holiday season!

They didn't want to bother me with it, and tried unsuccessfully on numerous occasions to work it out with Amazon Customer Service.  Finally, after they told me about the issue, I stepped in and Amazon acknowledged that the code was not working and asked if I wanted a replacement card or a refund.  Since I don't trust them with a replacement card, I asked for a refund which they said was fine and told me it went through.  I asked them to send me a confirmation email which they said they had done.  I told them it hadn't come in, and they said they would send it again.

I even used the chat to ask if I could use a nativity card and use one of the other cute tins, so it would be different this year.  they told me after a long waif that they can't do that.

The person who gave me this card, like many people do today, don't want to give something someone can't use or don't want so they give a gift card.  And with all that considerateness, I've ended up with a worthless gift card that's not activated.  I like using Amazon, but my own experience here with these cards is extremely negative.  I can see from the reviews that this is a VERY common problem, and Amazon, you're ending up with customer's money without them getting a product in exchange.

It's easy to use but you cannot use it for making reservations over the internet. You can use it pretty much like cash when you pay for your room at the end of your hotel stay. That's why it's a gift card. People who want to use it will need to make a room reservation using their own major credit card first but then during the check-in process do tell the hotel that you would pay using cash (gift card)at the time of check out--then use this card for check out.

This does bring some limitations on the usage and is a better gift for walk-in than advanced reservation (as one of the reviewers pointed out).","Nice gift to be used by ""walk-in"" customers",1366675200,

I ordered 3 of them, sent to an out of date email address.  When I found out about it I turned to Amazon customer service.  They gave me phone numbers and/or email addresses and told me to handle it myself.  OK.  I contacted each vendor individually.  1 of them I can only get an automated response saying that I need to talk to Amazon.
 The other 2 read me the part of the contract that says Amazon administers all of the gift card they issue.  So back to Amazon, who told me (again) to handle it myself.  I asked for a supervisor, who gave me the gift card numbers (which I did not previously have) and also told me she would forward the issue on to the gift card department.  She promised somebody would contact me within the next 2 days, and also told me that if I did not hear from anybody, to re-contact her.  It has been almost 3 weeks, and though I have tried multiple times, I have not heard from the gift card department, and all attempts to reach Timi again have gone unanswered.

The day I purchased it I went to print out the information about the spa and the spa had disappeared from the listing. When I called customer service they told me that this could happen. They also referred me to another phone center where they told me too bad....no refunds. I recognize there are many spas listed as accepting this gift card, but that was the only one in my son's location, and I had JUST (and I mean JUST) purchased the card online.

That's precisely why I purchased a $100 gift certificate for a close friend who has an specific interests in specific hobby areas. As a woodturner, no one would know precisely what tool I would want to purchase and interestingly enough I can find almost everything in that area on Amazon.com and usually at a reduced rate. So in this case, I found that purchasing a gift certificate from Amazon would be the ideal gift for this friend who has so many interests that for me to arbitrarily make a decision as to what to purchase for her could only cause her (and me indirectly) head aches. Needless to say, she was extremely happy to receive this gift certificate and she used it to purchase something that I would never had guessed that she would like. She found the item right away on Amazon. I personally have found that if I search Amazon for a particular item, that they rarely don't carry, they do provide alternate locations to look for that particular item. Now that's nice!

You really can't go wrong giving this gift card as a gift!

My only complaint is that over the years, they've gone from nice hard plastic cards to thin, cardboard cards. Also, if you write a message to the recipient, it will NOT appear inside the greeting card but on the packing slip.

My Mom had never seen video cards either, and she just loves them. Plays them a lot. And although I ordered Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on the 19th,  they arrived right on schedule, as selected. And the other two arrived within minutes of my sending them, as selected. Happiness delivered perfectly,  Bravo, Amazon! Although I got her quite a few presents, I also included an Amazon Gift Card  Santa Stuck in Chimney bookmark in a hardcover book she wanted, and an Amazon gift card in greeting card. She is very happy, and tonight I applied them all into her Amazon account for her. She's ecstatic to be able to shop now without a charge card. And lest you think I was left out, along with presents, my Mom gave me three Amazon gift cards she purchased in a grocery store for me. But now she's wishing she had purchased video cards, bookmarks, and greeting card styles for me from Amazon. She never checked them out, so didn't realize how much better to shop directly from Amazon. Wait till she sees the boxes and tins!

2. I also faced an issue to print the Amazon Gift Card.

Root cause analysis:
1. A bug in the payment system (could be a design miss or a bug the team didn't catch it before reaching production)
2. A bug in the print area

Hope Amazon can improve the customer experience.

Somewhere between it being scanned on the UPS truck and when UPS said the driver scanned the item as ""delivered"", it disappeared! Just saying, there's a lot of room for funny business here.  Are people inside UPS scanning items as ""delivered"" and pocketing them? In this case the ""recipient"" was waiting for delivery. Never saw UPS Truck or Driver, but all UPS will say is that the driver had to scan the item off the truck once delivered. No signature required? The Amazon ordering process does not offer the opportunity to request it be signed for.  According to UPS, only the ""shipper"" has the option to request a confirmation sig upon delivery and Amazon does not do that.  UPS says they are aware of their trucks being targeted and followed. A delivery is left on a porch and before the truck is gone, someone pilfers the package. The fact that they even told me that and don't mandate a recipient signature tells me that they don't have any concern for the customer. They stand by their driver, driver says it was left on a porch, then it was left on a porch. I was told that if I think it was stolen to file a police report. It took 3 calls to Amazon customer service but I found out that the ""delivered"" card had been redeemed by someone named ""Barbara"" who made a purchase thru her Amazon account. Call was escalated twice before I got the ear of a supervisor who took me seriously and attached a ""fraud"" alert to ""Barbara's"" account in that my stolen gift card was spent by her.  The matter is now in the hands of Amazon fraud dept.  YOU MUST READ THE GIFT CARD DISCLAIMER THAT AMAZON HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR GIFT CARDS LOST or STOLEN AFTER DELIVERY IS CONFIRMED.  Considering that no one has to sign as recipient, ""confirmed delivery"" is subjective. I am very appreciative that  Amazon tells me they will refund my gift card purchase and make me whole.  I will be visiting the police dept tomorrow to file that report.  You will NEVER catch me ordering a gift card on line for third party delivery ever again.",THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING AN UNSECURED GIFT CARD FOR UPS DELIVERY,1375920000,

It is set both in England and Normandy just after the Norman Conquest and it brings the period alive. It outlines the violence and unrest of the period which culminated in the horrors of the harrying of the north. However, set within these often brutal times the author cleverly gives us a moving love story between the Norman captor and the Saxon captive. The story is excellent, the heroine is passionate and the work is outstanding. My congratulations to Emily Murdoch for providing such an excellent read with such a tricky background for she proves herself both an excellent writer and a very knowledgeable historian. I most definitely recommend this book.",An outstanding work.,1467072000,

Regarding some problems brought up in other reviews: Fandango is an online site through which you buy movie tickets. Therefore -- no, you cannot use the card at a theater itself (just like you couldn't use a Ticketmaster gift card at a box office). There ARE convenience fees for buying online, just as there are for buying tickets for other events online. Personally, the fees don't bother me -- I tend to only really go to AMC theaters, and I have a Stubs card, which waives the Fandango fees.",Awesome for movie goers!,1485216000,

The smell is just like any other lotion with bronzers in it. My skin did not turn orange. I purposely left it on my palms and didn't wipe it off like everyone on the reviews said to, just so I could see if it really worked.  My hands are not orange.  I pretty much smeared myself in this stuff before I got into the bed because I loved how it went on.  I didn't get out and instantly see a tan like other people have said. I have slightly tan skin already from tanning but am naturally very very fair skinned. Later in the day, my skin got really dry from the bronzers.  I eventually looked quite a bit tanner. And by the next morning I was really dark. My legs usually take forever to show a tan and my abs are really dark. But this lotion made me have a pretty nice color by the next morning. I wouldn't ever use this without putting on a good rich lotion afterwards though because I drink 2 gallons of water/day and my skin was dry and dehydrated within about 2 hours after using this lotion.  So...bring a moisturizing lotion with you.  I am really happy with this lotion.  I will probably try a different kind for fun. And if I can't find another one that I like better then I will definitely buy this one again.  I like Black Smoke lotion better.  A lot of people hate that lotion but I still think it works better than this brand, minus the beautiful sheen this lotion gives you!  HAPPY I BOUGHT IT! WILL BUY AGAIN!",100x bronzer,1330646400,

I recommend Amazon Gift Cards to anyone who wanted so give a small or large ""Thank You Gift,"" birthday gift, Christmas gift, or any other gift.  It is easy.

Three of the four $100 cards had the same card number.  I also received 5 $100 cards and only 1 $50 card.  When I tried to call and get things straightened out the first operator was really nice and realized that I had been sent $50 extra and annotated on my account that I was not to be billed for the extra $50.  Upon looking at the cards after downloading them I noticed that three of the five $100 cards had the same card number applied to them.  When I called Amazon back to inform them of this second error, I was treated very rudely and was speaking to an operator who spoke very choppy English and I could barely understand her and she had no idea what I was talking about.  I asked to speak to someone who could speak better English and I was put on HOLD for over 20 minutes.  I called back and was once again put on HOLD.

I also purchased the 1st season of Downton Abbey DVD - a UK series shown on PBS - the 2nd season has just started on PBS last week.  I'd give both products and the gift cards 5 *.  Oh the RYO machine was the Top o Matic (not the T2) after reading other people's reviews - so I also use the reviews frequently.  Amazon is so easy to shop from and I think I've always been happy with everything I've purchased from them - I also have a Kindle w/free 3G (older cheaper model) and I use it so much since I can download free real books from my library system.

Unlike so many of the other 1-star ratings where people had losses of money and time using Amazon gift cards, I lost nothing (except the time expended on trying to place this order for a surprise Valentines day gift and to write this review).  Amazon lost money, as my purchase:

I had them printed out and placed in my envelopes in less than 10 minutes.  By giving an Amazon gift card, it allows the user to purchase anything they want.  That is why I purchased them for my employees.  The only suggestion I would give to the website, is to list the code that is unique to each card on the memo portion, next to the ""print now"" button.  I purchased multiple cards and wanted to double check to make sure I print out each of them.  I had to open each card to compare the codes that were printed.  It would have made this process easier if the code was on the memo portion.  I plan to purchase more cards in the future because of the convenience and because each of my employees were happy.

The nearest location is 64 miles away in Lexington, KY. I contacted the company and never heard back from them. We travel to Lexington every few months on business so we when we went last Sept we used $22.24 of the $50. We went a couple of weeks ago and when they keyed in our number they said there was a 0 balance. I said impossible as there was still $27.76 left on the card and had my last receipt that showed that balance. They said sorry you will have to call the 1-800 number on the card. It's a paper printed off the computer so there is no 1-800 number on the card. I tried to find a number on their website which is next to impossible. I finally did and left a message and still no one has returned my call. I did find on their website that you can put your card number in and it gives you the history of your card. Mine shows that the balance was used about a month after I used it in Nebraska!! I have never in my life been to Nebraska but apparently someone there keyed my number in either on purpose or by mistake. So it looks like I spent $40 for a gift card that I used once for $22.24.

They rip you off by charging you a 3 dollar convenience fee on top of the original price of the movie tickets. Since Im a student I get a student discount on tickets at a theater near my collage. As a result my wife and I can get once set of tickets with the gift card but if we try and use the gift card with the student discount a second time it is more expensive to use the last two dollars on the gift card with the $3 fee then it is to just go into the theater and purchase tickets straight from them and throw the card away! They won't take the card in the theater so the only way to use it is to pay that stupid fee! Waste of money. Just give your friends cash in an envelope with a label that says movie gift card.

I did a chat and email with amazon with some rude and uncaring response.  In the end an email of apology was sent indicating I would have my account credited.  It did not say the card which was now in the mail to the grandson who did not get it that morning was canceled.  Needless to say this led to some embarrassment to my wife and I but I simply gave him cash when I next saw him and he was happy enough and understanding.  The issue is if you are going to cancel out the value of a card make it very clear to a customer before you do it.  Amazon has my payment info on file so to handle it the way they did really stinks.

You pull the egg from the top and bottom and it slides open with a ""pop"", displaying the gift card inside.  The printing is professional and the magenta areas are actually shiny/glossy.  It's made of thick, high quality card stock and should hold up to the tugging of almost any child - in fact, you could probably reuse it a number of times.  There's plenty of space on the back to write a message, so there's no need to spend money on a separate greeting card.  The card also has no branding, so you can replace the Amazon gift card with some other gift card if you wish.  The cartoon chicken and the bright colors will appeal to young children, but it's also mature & simplistic enough to be appropriate for a teen or adult.  I was very impressed by the quality of an item that is essentially free, and I definitely recommend this for an Easter present or any egg-related holiday.

The item came completely undamaged in a sealed plastic cover and was well protected during shipping, but YMMV.  Sometimes Amazon's gift card tins arrive dented and scratched, and other times they're in perfect condition - it all depends on the person who packages and handles it.",and I definitely recommend this for an Easter present or any egg-related holiday,1454025600,

I made sure it was in my Android pay and took it to Safeway. They said it had to be printed. So I had to drive to an OfficeMax a few miles away to get it printed. Then I took it back and used all but $4.08 of it. The printed giftcard says it can also be used at Albertsons which I wish I would have known to begin with as Albertsons is much closer to me. So I took the giftcard to use the remaining balance at Albertson's where they said they'd have to convert it to one of their cards. They couldn't check the balance without calling some number that took over 30 minutes to verify I had $4.08 just as I had told them and shown on a previous receipt. But, uh-oh, they can't do a giftcard for anything under $5. So I had to spend .92 cents to purchase the giftcard with my existing gifcard to use it in their store. Such a mess!

Not horrible, but it did drop my overall rating on this down by 1 star.

These are perfect to keep around at the holidays because there is inevitably several people who give us remembrances whom we forgot to get something for.  I find that buying these ahead of time and having several at home, even keeping a blank Christmas card along with an amazon gift card ready in the car is super useful.  It's waiting in case I'm surprised at a Christmas party or church gathering and want to be able to give someone something on the spot. A five minute trip to the car, fill out the card and boom! Jonny on the spot ready to give a Christmas remembrance.

Also, you don't use them this year, they are still just as useful next year. If you are not the time to keep track of something for a full 12 months, then apply them to your own account. It's a win-win, hands down.","Keeping these on hand is super useful, and they NEVER go to waste",1460332800,

He was non communicative, not quite, but nearly rude, and took a very long time, with voiceless poises, not explaining what he was doing.  On more than one occasion, my recipient was unsure if the call had been cut off.  Finally, after nearly half an hour, they were able, by trial and error, to guess what the missing digit was and activate the money.  Is this from a third party selling Amazon cards?

I am shopping for Amazon.com gift cards for Christmas gifts and am really so disappointed that out of five choices there isn't one that says ""Merry Christmas"" or mentions Christmas at all!  I am sure I am not alone in wanting a card that reflects the actual ""holiday"" we are celebrating. On principle, I cannot send a Amazon gift card this Christmas.

I have been a Netflix user for a long time and I would buy gift cards for myself at times since I thought it's the same as credit card payment anyways. However, I did not realize there is one big disappointing surprise of using these gift cards..

What happened is that I will be traveling abroad for a few months and was hoping to put my account on hold in the meanwhile and will resume my membership after I come back. However, I was told that the only way to put my account ""on hold"" is to cancel my membership and reactivate when I come back. However, when I clicked the cancel membership button, I was told that my membership will only be canceled after all of my credit are used up. I still have more than $48 dollars of credit from previous gift card purchase and having my accounting charged for the next 4 months completely defeats the purpose of canceling my account which is to put it on temporarily hold without getting charged.

I called the help center and the lady told me there is no way to put my account on hold without getting charged since I have purchased gift cards. I told her it makes no sense as it seems I am being ""punished"" for pre-depositing money at Netflix by using giftcards, which she agreed! she then said she'll talk to her team to see if they can help. To my big surprise, after being put on hold for 10+ minutes, instead of helping with a solution, she came back reading a bunch of terms and agreements that I ""agreed"" when I sign up, essentially saying ""this is what you agreed to, even though I agree it makes no sense, but we're legally protected""

anyways, really frustrating experience. one thing for sure is that I will not being resuming my membership after my credit runs out!

Just want to share my horrible experience of using Netflix giftcards. so please be aware.

Thanks.",Just want to share my horrible experience of using Netflix giftcards,1480204800,

When I checked in with her on her birthday, she had not received it at all. (She also checked her junk/spam folder, although she is already an Amazon customer and nothing there).  When I contacted Amazon about it, they apologized for the mistake and thought there must have been a glitch in their internal system.

This is just a regular gift card. That's exactly what I wanted. However, I would have preferred to purchase the Amazon gift cards that come in those cute little gift boxes, but they only have them for cards worth like $50 or higher! Also, I wish that Amazon had gift cards that were worth $10 because if I'm going to buy gift cards for a bunch of little kids, $15 is a lot! Amazon should really consider allowing the customer to decide what the exact value of a card should be because tailoring the price could be really creative. For example, I got a check for graduation worth $20.11 because I graduated in 2011.",It's a gift card,1386806400,

They don't accept these cards at the theaters. They want you to purchase tickets online and they will charge you a service fee so you will not get face value of the gift card. On top of that the card is not even accepted when you try to apply the gift card on a purchase. Tried to call but they are busy on a Sunday?

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off. We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price.

When she told me about it, I contacted Amazon myself via chat, explained the situation above, and they copied and pasted a script saying how to resend the gift card electronically ....not good....then stated if I had an issue it was Sephora's to care for and there was nothing they could do to help me.  I then called in and asked to speak to a supervisor.  The supervisor had me repeat my zip code like seven times, did not once offer any empathy and reiterated this was Sephora's problem.  When I voiced my frustration, then she actually read through the account and said she was sending the issue to 'the gift card escalation department' and they would contact me in 24-48hrs.  There is no way to contact them directly and she was unable to provide me with her employee number or name other than first name and initial, probably a reason why no ownership was taken on the call.
